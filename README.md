# Football Score Tracker - Built for Garmin

Keeping track of a 5 a-side game is almost impossible! When the scores 12-11, your being shouted at by the goalie who says it time to change keepers, and your struggling to keep track of your marker, let alone everything else.

So, I built an app to help with all that! Set the team names, length of game, intervals (for breaks or goalie changes etc.), and most importantly, easily keep track of the score, leaving the user to just enjoy the game.

## Summary 

A Garmin ConnectIQ app for keeping score during a football game. Users can set the timer, intervals, team names, and update the scores.

Fully depolyed on the Garmin Connect IQ store. [Download](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/5d8fbcc0-b650-4a0d-87dd-f5acb095d1ed#0)

Built using Monkey-C.

## Why?

Every week I played 5aSide with my friends but keeping score was a nightmare. I played with my garmin watch to track my exercise and thought "why can't I use my watch to keep score?". I looked on the ConnectIQ store and there wasn't an app like this, so I decided to build one myself.

## Version Control

MVP: Increment the "score" of 2 teams and have team names to reference each score. Achieved in 4hrs.

Version 1.1: Timer that increments each second. Current time included on view.

Version 1.2: Customise team names. Set timer to decrease and notify user on completion. Reduce the score to fix user errors.

Version 1.3: Intervals to allow for keeper changes/breaks, user if notified on completion. Enabled for Vivoactive watches that are touchscreen, therefore need to detect different inputs 

## Monkey C

Monkey C was built by Garmin to allow developers to create apps for Garmin devices. Monkey C derives heavily from other popular languages. C, Java™, JavaScript, Python™, Lua, Ruby, and PHP all influenced the design for Monkey C.
